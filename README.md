# Cornell Course Advisor

A Machine Learning Model to tell you want course at Cornell University could be a good fit for you based on your interests!

To run the model, clone this repository, and install the necessary packages, and run the following command:

```
subjects = ""   # fill in your subjects
query = ""      # fill in your query
python main.py subjects query
```

Insert the subjects you want the model to consider in the first argument as a string, and insert your query as the second argument as a string.
